# Principled Approaches to Handle Sample Size & Power Issues in ANOVA

## Overview: The Core Problem

ANOVA's reliability depends on having adequate statistical power, but real-world data often presents challenges:
- Unequal group sizes
- Small sample sizes
- Uncertain effect sizes
- Violated assumptions

Here are principled ways to handle these issues, both **prospectively** (during planning) and **retrospectively** (with existing data).

---

## Part 1: Prospective Solutions (Study Design Phase)

### 1.1 Power Analysis & Sample Size Planning

**The Gold Standard:** Calculate required sample size *before* data collection.

#### For Equal Group Sizes

Required sample size per group for ANOVA:

$$n = \frac{k \cdot (Z_{\alpha} + Z_{\beta})^2}{f^2}$$

where:
- $k$ = number of groups
- $Z_{\alpha}$ = 1.96 for $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed)
- $Z_{\beta}$ = 0.84 for 80% power, 1.28 for 90% power
- $f$ = Cohen's f (effect size)

**For α = 0.05, 80% power:**

$$n \approx \frac{7.85k}{f^2}$$

**Example:** 4 groups, medium effect (f = 0.25)
$$n = \frac{7.85 \times 4}{0.25^2} = \frac{31.4}{0.0625} \approx 502 \text{ total (126 per group)}$$

#### For Unequal Group Sizes (Fixed Ratio)

If you must use unequal groups (e.g., due to natural group proportions):

1. Calculate required $n_{eff}$ using the formula above
2. Solve for individual group sizes maintaining your ratio

**Example:** Need $n_{eff} = 100$, ratio 2:1:1 (4 groups)

$$n_{eff} = \frac{k}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n_i}} = 100$$

If $n_1 = 2x$, $n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = x$:

$$100 = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{2x} + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{2x} + \frac{3}{x}} = \frac{4x \cdot 2}{1 + 6} = \frac{8x}{7}$$

$$x = \frac{700}{8} = 87.5 \approx 88$$

**Result:** $n_1 = 176$, $n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = 88$ (total N = 440)

**Cost of imbalance:** Compared to balanced design (n = 110 × 4 = 440), we need same total N but with less efficient allocation.

#### Software Tools for Power Analysis

- **R:** `pwr.anova.test()` from `pwr` package
- **Python:** `statsmodels.stats.power` module
- **G*Power:** Free standalone software
- **Online calculators:** e.g., Sample Size Calculators

### 1.2 Optimal Allocation Strategies

#### Strategy A: Equal Allocation (Default Choice)

**When to use:** Unless you have strong reasons otherwise

**Advantages:**
- Maximizes statistical power for fixed total N
- Most robust to assumption violations
- Simplest to analyze and interpret

**Rule:** Always prefer equal n when possible

#### Strategy B: Proportional Allocation

**When to use:** When groups represent natural population proportions

**Example:** Disease subtypes where Type A is 50%, Type B is 30%, Type C is 20%

If total budget N = 300:
- Type A: 150 samples
- Type B: 90 samples  
- Type C: 60 samples

**Trade-off:** Better population representation, but lower power than equal allocation

**Calculate effective sample size:**
$$n_{eff} = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{150} + \frac{1}{90} + \frac{1}{60}} = 90$$

Compare to equal allocation (n = 100 each → $n_{eff} = 100$). You lose 10% power.

#### Strategy C: Optimal Allocation with Unequal Variances

**When to use:** When you know groups have different variances

**Neyman allocation:** Allocate more samples to higher-variance groups

$$n_i \propto \sigma_i$$

Specifically:
$$n_i = N \cdot \frac{\sigma_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} \sigma_j}$$

**Example:** 3 groups, N = 300, $\sigma_1 = 10$, $\sigma_2 = 15$, $\sigma_3 = 20$

Total: $10 + 15 + 20 = 45$

- $n_1 = 300 \times \frac{10}{45} = 67$
- $n_2 = 300 \times \frac{15}{45} = 100$
- $n_3 = 300 \times \frac{20}{45} = 133$

**Advantage:** Minimizes total variance of effect estimates

**Disadvantage:** Requires prior knowledge of variances

### 1.3 Handling Budget Constraints

#### The Trade-off Matrix

| Scenario | Solution | Trade-off |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Limited total budget | Use equal allocation | Maximize power per dollar |
| One group is expensive | Allocate fewer to expensive group | Accept lower power |
| Need minimum per group | Set floor (e.g., n ≥ 30), distribute rest | Ensure basic validity |
| Pilot study | Use n = 20-30 per group | Exploratory only; plan follow-up |

#### Minimum Sample Size Floors

**Recommended minimums:**
- **Absolute floor:** n ≥ 20 per group (for CLT to apply reasonably)
- **Conservative floor:** n ≥ 30 per group (standard recommendation)
- **For small effects:** n ≥ 85 per group (to detect f = 0.10)

**If you can't meet minimums:**
1. Reduce number of groups (combine categories if scientifically justified)
2. Focus on larger effect sizes only
3. Use Bayesian methods or non-parametric alternatives
4. Conduct pilot study and plan larger follow-up

---

## Part 2: Retrospective Solutions (Existing Data)

### 2.1 Calculate Achieved Power

When you already have data, compute what you *can* detect:

#### Step-by-step workflow:

**1. Calculate effective sample size:**

$$n_{eff} = \frac{k}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n_i}}$$

**2. Calculate pooled variance:**

$$\sigma_{pooled}^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_i - 1)s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_i - 1)}$$

**3. Estimate effect size from your data:**

$$f = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i(\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_{..})^2}{(k-1) \sigma_{pooled}^2}}$$

Or use **eta-squared:** $\eta^2 = \frac{SSB}{SST}$, then $f = \sqrt{\frac{\eta^2}{1-\eta^2}}$

**4. Calculate minimum detectable effect:**

$$f_{min} = \frac{2.8}{\sqrt{n_{eff}}} \quad \text{(for 80% power, α = 0.05)}$$

**5. Compare:**
- If $f > f_{min}$: You have adequate power ✓
- If $f \approx f_{min}$: Borderline power (~80%) ⚠️
- If $f < f_{min}$: Underpowered ✗

#### Interpretation Guidelines

| Achieved Power | Interpretation | Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| > 80% | Adequate | Report results with confidence |
| 60-80% | Moderate | Report with caveats about power |
| 40-60% | Low | Treat as exploratory |
| < 40% | Very low | Results unreliable; need more data |

### 2.2 Dealing with Small or Unequal Sample Sizes

#### Option 1: Use Welch's ANOVA

**When to use:** Unequal variances across groups (Levene's test p < 0.05)

**Advantages:**
- Does not assume equal variances (relaxes homogeneity assumption)
- More robust with unequal sample sizes
- Similar interpretation to regular ANOVA

**Implementation:**
- **R:** `oneway.test(y ~ group, data, var.equal = FALSE)`
- **Python:** `scipy.stats.f_oneway()` followed by Games-Howell post-hoc

**Trade-off:** Slightly less power if variances truly are equal, but more robust overall

---

#### Option 2: Use Non-parametric Alternative

**Kruskal-Wallis Test:** Rank-based alternative to ANOVA

**When to use:**
- Small sample sizes (n < 20 per group)
- Non-normal distributions
- Ordinal data or severe outliers

**Advantages:**
- No normality assumption
- Robust to outliers
- Can handle very small samples (n ≥ 5 per group)

**Disadvantages:**
- Tests medians, not means
- Slightly less powerful if data truly normal
- More difficult to interpret effect sizes

**Implementation:**
- **R:** `kruskal.test(y ~ group, data)`
- **Python:** `scipy.stats.kruskal(group1, group2, group3, ...)`

**Post-hoc:** Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction

---

#### Option 3: Bootstrap Methods

**When to use:** Uncertain about distributional assumptions

**Approach:**
1. Resample with replacement within each group
2. Calculate F-statistic on bootstrap sample
3. Repeat 10,000 times
4. Build empirical distribution of F under null

**Advantages:**
- Makes minimal distributional assumptions
- Works with small, unequal samples
- Provides accurate p-values even with violated assumptions

**Implementation (R example):**
```r
library(boot)
# Define statistic function
f_stat <- function(data, indices) {
  d <- data[indices, ]
  fit <- aov(value ~ group, data = d)
  summary(fit)[[1]]$`F value`[1]
}

# Bootstrap
boot_results <- boot(data, f_stat, R = 10000)
```

---

#### Option 4: Bayesian ANOVA

**When to use:**
- Small sample sizes where frequentist inference is questionable
- Want to incorporate prior information
- Need probabilistic statements about effects

**Advantages:**
- Naturally handles uncertainty in small samples
- Can incorporate expert knowledge via priors
- Provides credible intervals for effects
- No p-value interpretation issues

**Key output:** Posterior probability that group means differ

**Implementation:**
- **R:** `BayesFactor` package, `anovaBF()` function
- **Python:** `PyMC` or `Stan` for custom models

**Example interpretation:**
- Bayes Factor BF₁₀ = 10: Data are 10× more likely under H₁ than H₀
- BF₁₀ > 3: Moderate evidence for difference
- BF₁₀ > 10: Strong evidence for difference

---

### 2.3 Combining Small Groups

**When scientifically justified**, consider collapsing groups:

#### Decision Tree:

```
Are some groups similar a priori?
├─ YES: Consider combining if:
│  ├─ Preliminary test shows no difference (p > 0.25)
│  ├─ Scientific theory suggests equivalence
│  └─ Effect sizes are small (d < 0.2 between them)
└─ NO: Keep separate but report power limitations
```

**Example:** Drug doses
- Original: Placebo, Low (10mg), Medium (20mg), High (30mg)
- If Low ≈ Medium in pilot data: Combine into "Active Treatment" vs Placebo

**⚠️ Warning:** Never combine groups based solely on non-significance in your main study (this is p-hacking)

---

### 2.4 Reporting Practices for Underpowered Studies

If you can't increase sample size, at least report transparently:

#### Essential elements to report:

1. **Actual sample sizes per group:** Be explicit about imbalance
   
2. **Achieved power calculation:** 
   - "Our design had 65% power to detect a medium effect (f = 0.25)"

3. **Minimum detectable effect size:**
   - "We could reliably detect effects of f ≥ 0.35 (large effects only)"

4. **Confidence intervals:** 
   - Always report CIs for effect estimates, not just p-values
   - Wide CIs reveal uncertainty in underpowered studies

5. **Effect size estimates:**
   - Report Cohen's f or η² even if p > 0.05
   - A non-significant result could be d = 0.4 (medium effect) with wide CI

6. **Interpretation caveats:**
   - "Non-significant results should be interpreted cautiously given modest power"
   - "Our study was adequately powered only for large effects"

#### Example Results Section:

> *"We conducted a one-way ANOVA with four groups (n₁ = 25, n₂ = 30, n₃ = 35, n₄ = 40; nₑff = 31.7). Post-hoc power analysis indicated 70% power to detect medium effects (f = 0.25). The omnibus test was not significant, F(3, 126) = 2.1, p = .10, η² = 0.05 [90% CI: 0.00, 0.11]. Given our modest sample size, we cannot rule out small-to-medium effects and recommend these findings be considered preliminary."*

## Part 3: Advanced Considerations

### 3.1 Sequential Analysis & Adaptive Designs

Instead of fixed sample sizes, consider **sequential testing**:

#### Group Sequential Design:

1. Plan multiple interim analyses (e.g., at 50%, 75%, 100% of target n)
2. Use adjusted alpha at each stage (e.g., O'Brien-Fleming boundaries)
3. Stop early if strong effect detected
4. Stop for futility if no effect likely

**Advantages:**
- Can stop early if effect is clear (save resources)
- Can stop if effect unlikely (avoid wasting time)
- Maintains Type I error control

**Software:** `gsDesign` package in R

---

### 3.2 Equivalence Testing

If your goal is to show groups are **similar**, use equivalence tests instead of ANOVA:

**Framework:** Show that any difference is smaller than a practically meaningful threshold Δ

**TOST (Two One-Sided Tests):**
- Test both: μᵢ - μⱼ > -Δ AND μᵢ - μⱼ < Δ
- If both reject, conclude equivalence

**Requires:** Larger samples than standard ANOVA (equivalence is harder to prove than difference)

---

### 3.3 Meta-Analytic Thinking

If you have multiple small studies rather than one adequately powered study:

**Option:** Meta-analyze across studies
- Pool effect sizes using random-effects model
- Provides more precise estimate than individual studies
- Assess heterogeneity (I²)

**Caveat:** Only valid if studies are methodologically similar

## Summary: Practical Recommendations

### Planning Phase (Best Practice):
1. ✓ Conduct formal power analysis
2. ✓ Aim for equal group sizes whenever possible
3. ✓ Target 80-90% power for expected effect size
4. ✓ Set minimum floor of n ≥ 30 per group
5. ✓ Plan for 20-30% attrition/missing data

### Analysis Phase with Existing Data:
1. ✓ Calculate and report achieved power
2. ✓ Check assumptions; use robust methods if violated
3. ✓ Report effect sizes and confidence intervals
4. ✓ Be transparent about limitations
5. ✓ Consider Bayesian or bootstrap methods for small n

### Never Do:
- ✗ Combine groups based on non-significance in your data
- ✗ Ignore power issues and report only p-values
- ✗ Claim "no effect" from underpowered non-significant result
- ✗ Collect more data after seeing results (without sequential design)
