> - **x** = wealth threshold, ranging from some minimum $x_{min}$ (say, $1,000) to infinity
> - **y** = number of people with wealth ≥ x (frequency)
> - **k** = a constant determined by the total population and $x_{min}$. Often written as $k = N \cdot x_{min}^\alpha$ where N is total population
> - **α** = the exponent (typically negative, around -1.161 for 80-20)

> So if $\alpha \approx -1.161$, the relationship is: $y = k \, x^{-1.161}$

> **Concrete example**: If you have 1 million people and set $x_{min} = \$10,000$:
> - At x = $10,000: many people have at least this much
> - At x = $100,000: fewer people (about 100,000 people if α = -1.161)
> - At x = $1,000,000: very few people (about 10,000 people)

> The magic of α ≈ -1.161 is that it makes the top 20% of people hold exactly 80% of the total wealth.
